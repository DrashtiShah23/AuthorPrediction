# Project: Author Classification of Horror Story Excerpts

Aim:
The primary aim of this project is to predict the author of excerpts from horror stories written by Edgar Allan Poe, Mary Shelley, and H.P. Lovecraft using machine learning techniques.

Overview:
This project focuses on utilizing natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning algorithms to classify the authorship of horror story excerpts. By analyzing the unique writing styles and language patterns of each author, we aim to build a predictive model capable of accurately attributing excerpts to their respective authors.

Key Features:

Dataset Exploration: Analyze the dataset containing excerpts from horror stories by Edgar Allan Poe, Mary Shelley, and H.P. Lovecraft to understand the distribution and characteristics of the data.
Text Preprocessing: Implement preprocessing techniques such as tokenization, stop word removal, and lemmatization to prepare the text data for modeling.
Feature Engineering: Extract relevant features from the text data, such as word frequency, n-grams, and syntactic features, to capture author-specific writing styles.
Model Selection: Experiment with various machine learning algorithms, including logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, and support vector machines, to identify the most suitable model for author classification.
Model Evaluation: Evaluate the performance of the trained models using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to assess their effectiveness in author classification.
Hyperparameter Tuning: Fine-tune the parameters of the selected model using techniques like grid search and cross-validation to optimize performance.
Prediction and Interpretation: Use the trained model to predict the authorship of unseen horror story excerpts and interpret the results to gain insights into the distinguishing features of each author's writing style.
